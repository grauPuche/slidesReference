# SLIDES REFERENCE

Each slide's ID has a number. in the list bellow each number will make reference to the slide.

1. `trigger = raise hand` :: `#logo`

1. `trigger = raise hand` :: `#step-2`
   - add the icon as shown
   - design reference [here](01.jpg)
   - raise-hand [icon](assets/raisehand.svg) 

1. `trigger = wave hands` :: `#step-3`
   - add the icon as shown
   - design reference [here](02.jpg)
   - wave [icon](assets/wave.svg)

1. `trigger = hover bttn`  :: `#step-4`
   - add camera feed on the specified area
   - the hover button should have a orange "loading-line" (`#ff5039`)
   - design reference [here](03.jpg)
   - hover [icon](assets/hover.svg)

1. `trigger = raise hand`  :: `#whoAreWe-5`
   - make sure the content does not get cut depending on the mask size (landscape only. test `1080` & `720` resolutions)

1. `trigger = raise hand`  :: `#whatWeDo-6`
   - same as slide **5**, be aware of resolutions and not cutting content
   - make sure the video plays (test multiple times)

1. `trigger = timeuot`  :: `#onOff-7`
   - there is no CV trigger. the slide has "autoplay" make sure it work.

1. `trigger = raise hand`  :: `#howItWorks-8`
   8. there is a zoomed-in slide called `displays-8`. It has a timer and needs no trigger (like **7**)

1. `trigger = raise hand`  :: `#displays-9`
   - make sure the video plays consistently

1. `trigger = timeout`  :: `#displays-10`
   - (like **5 & 7**) no need for CV trigger

1. `trigger = raise hand`  :: `#displays-11`

1. `trigger = raise hand`  :: `#conversions-12`
   - make sure the red boxes appear on the center of the slide (test different mask sizes, specially **720p**)

1. `trigger = raise hand`  :: `#conversions-13`
   - same as **12**

1. `trigger = raise hand`  :: `#conversions-14`
   - same as **12** & **13**

1. `trigger = raise hand`  :: `#conversions-15`
   - same as **12,13** & **14**

1. `trigger = raise hand`  :: `#caseOne-16`
   - make sure the videos fit (as mentioned before)

1. `trigger = raise hand`  :: `#caseOne-17`
   - make sure the videos fit (as mentioned before)

1. `trigger = raise hand`  :: `#caseOne-18`
   - make sure the videos fit (as mentioned before)

1. `trigger = three smiles`  :: `#demo-19`
   - the idea is to make a trigger based on the smiles that appear on the feed. to activate the trigger, **3 smiles** are needed
   - if this is not possible the slide should be taken out. if so, **notify Omer+Tal**
   - change the opacity of the icons for each new smile (until 3)

1. `trigger = raise hand`  :: `#step-20`
   - here the app `app-demo-triggers` should be embedded
   - If the "app-pause" mechanism was able to be added more apps might need to be after this one.
